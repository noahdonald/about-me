I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): I think this was useful for me to be able to see how to 
use a seperate file to style the page. This seems like a good way to make a project
look a lot less messy. It seems like it would be easier to read code that is written
this way, so this is likely a way that I would create my own project.

            <h2>My personal interests</h2>
            <p>One thing that I really love is music. I like it in all forms. I like collecting records, I like searching for new music online, 
            and I enjoy a lot of concerts. Live music is the best way to enjoy it, I think.<br><br>Another thing that I really enjoy is film.
            I love trying to decipher the message that a movie is trying to convey and talking about it with others. I love finding obscure movies
            to show to people.<br><br>A recent interest I have taken up is boxing. I'm not very good as it is still new to me, but it started out 
            as a way to get in shape and has turned into a real interest in boxing as a sport. I'm hoping to get good enough to spar in the next year.</p>
